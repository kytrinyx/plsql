# Rna Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for PL/SQL to get ready to code:

## Running the Tests

Execute the tests by calling the `run` method in the respective `ut_<exercise>#` package.
The necessary code should be contained at the end of the test package.
As an example, the test for the _hamming_ exercise would be run using

```
begin
  ut_hamming#.run;
end;
/
```
